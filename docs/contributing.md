# Contributing

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for taking the time to contribute to `pyinfra`! ðŸŽ‰

Third party pull requests help expand pyinfra's functionality and are essential to it's continued growth. This guide should help get you started adding additional operations, facts and other functionality to pyinfra.

## Guides

+ [How to write operations](api/operations)
+ [How to write facts](api/facts)
+ [How to write connectors](api/connectors)
+ [API reference](api/reference)

## Branches

+ The default branch, `current`, tracks ongoing work for the current _minor_ version, ie `1.3`.
+ The `next` branch tracks work for the next release, ie `1.4`
+ There is a branch per major version, ie `1.x`, that tracks the latest release of that version

Essentially this means if you're making a PR for a bugfix base off `current`, and for feature work (new operations, etc) base off `next`.

A release sees `next` rebased onto `current` and the major branch fast forwarded to that commit, as well as a tag added for that version.

## Dev Setup

```sh
# Create a virtualenv with your tool of choice
# python -m venv / pyenv virtualenv / virtualenv

# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Fizzadar/pyinfra.git

# Install the package in editable mode with development requirements
cd pyinfra
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Tests

Use `pytest` to run tests, or `pytest --cov` to run with coverage. Pull requests are expected to be tested and not drop overall project coverage by >1%.

## Generate Documentation

To generate:

```sh
sphinx-build -a docs/ docs/build/
```

To view ([localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)):

```sh
python -m http.server -d docs/build/
```

## Code Style
